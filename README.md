# MyNotes
ANDROID STUDIO PROJECT
<br><br>
A simple app that allows the user to take the notes in his/her phone.
<br>
It involved basic concepts of activity navigation(intent) , list views, alert dialogues,action bars and permanent storage methods.
<br>
I have implemented the method of "Shared Preferences" to be able to  without any requirement of database.store the data entered by the users permanently
